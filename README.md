### Date created
5/9/2022

### Project Title
Bikeshare

### Description
This is a python code project that I copied from Osamashaban (https://github.com/Osamashaban/Explore_US_Bikeshare_Data) as I am taking the R version of this course and used the Jupityer notebook for my 2nd project and thus had no R code to use. This solution was suggested by one of the Mentors (Oscar) in the Ask a Mentor section when a previous student had the same issue. This bikeshare project provides data collected from a bikeshare company based in three different cities and allows the user to interrogate the data with their chosen programming language. 

### Files used
bikeshare.py - source code
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Credits
As stated above, this project was copied from Osamashaban (https://github.com/Osamashaban/Explore_US_Bikeshare_Data) as I could not use my own project. The below is copied from their README file.

# Overview
In This Project I will use a Python to Explore Data for Bikeshare system in three cities in United State (Chicago, New York City, Washington) , I will import Data from 3 files contain all details for the system on the three cites , user will chose variable of city, month, week to display the data selected as output to have a pref about customer of project  and some details .
## Software Do I Need : 
To Compelet the Project You have install : 
- You shuld have Python , Pandas and Numpy it's all powerd by Anaconda
- any text Editor for coding like Atom , jupyter
- Terminal command Line Basics for run code (MAC , Linux, Windows)

# Project Details : 
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

## The Datasets : 
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year

## Statistics Computed : 
### 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

### 2 Popular stations and trip

- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

### 3 Trip duration

- total travel time
- average travel time

### 4 User info

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

# How To Run The Project :
